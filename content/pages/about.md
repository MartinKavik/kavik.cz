I'm **Martin**. I live in Prague (Czechia). 

My first paid task was writing a PHP web framework 15 years ago. I still experiment, write libraries and apps, and create designs for my clients — mostly in Rust.

I enjoy spicy food, poppy seed strudels, smaller towns, one-on-one conversations, and remote work. I'm not a fan of daily meetings or inflexible working hours.

I've jumped off a bridge and out of a plane. Programmed hardware and software for a football launcher. Received a grant to work on the FastWave project for a year. Used to lift weights; now, I lift toys. 

In my free time, I create the Boon language, maintain the MoonZoon framework, write a platform for freelancers and open-source devs, or play with my daughter. I've composed a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mNv0QXfPhE) for guitar. Unfortunately, my hands are too small and I can't really play guitar.

With my little project in Trondheim 2024. She'll speak Czech, English, Norwegian, Boon and Rust (optional).

![Boon Playground](/images/boon_playground.png)

Boon is a language for writing apps.

- Declarative, statically-typed, based on Rust streams. 
- The runtime remembers its values, enabling website hot-reloading and state persistence (replacing databases) as built-in features.
- No locks in the runtime, allowing even easy multi-threaded web frontend development.
- [Persons.pro](https://persons.pro/) will be the first web app written in Boon.
- The playground is written using the Rust MoonZoon framework and integrates CodeMirror editor.
- Use cases: Everywhere Rust may not be well-suited.

The goal is to answer these questions:
- _"How simple can a useful language be?"_
- _"Can databases, file storage, threads, and protocols be used transparently?"_
- _"Can we kill an app and then later resume it?"_
- _"Can an app be monitored or partly developed like in factory automation games?"_
