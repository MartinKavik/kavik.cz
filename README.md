## Roadmap

- Refactor.
- Add tasks for formatting and linting.
- Use it as the base for the next [MartinKavik/seed-quickstart-webpack](https://github.com/MartinKavik/seed-quickstart-webpack) version.
- Write documentation.
- Experiment with lightweight custom layout engine to make code simpler and more readable. (It will be a part of the [Hellweb project](https://github.com/MartinKavik/hellweb-pain)).
- Write simple cookieless analytics based on [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/). (Probably a part of the [Hellweb project](https://github.com/MartinKavik/hellweb-pain), too).
