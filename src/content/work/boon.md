Boon is a declarative language where the runtime remembers values across reloads, enabling hot-reloading and state persistence without a database.

Statically typed with a Factorio-inspired visual debugger.

Currently powered by a Rust interpreter with a custom lock-free actor-based engine. Exploring Differential Dataflow as an alternative — engines switchable in the Playground.
