Hire a freelancer? Platform takes 10-20%. Sponsor a creator? 5-12%. Sell an ebook? Up to 30% gone. Plus 3-5% payment processing fees.

**The fix:**
- Modern banking or stablecoins for near-zero fees.
- Escrow with visible funds that can earn returns.
- Verified identities, fewer scams.

**Future:** Local-first app with *Boon*, *LocalSearch*, and *nostr* or *iroh*. Eventually: *Concordium* for KYC and transactions.
