A platform for freelancers, open-source creators, and their clients.

I've designed it in Figma and built a responsive homepage in MoonZoon.

**The problem:** Platforms like Upwork take 20% cuts. PayPal and banks add more fees. International transfers are slow and costly.

**The idea:** Cut transaction costs with crypto or modern banking. Add KYC so you know you're hiring a real person (matters more now with AI-generated profiles everywhere). Let escrowed money earn modest returns instead of sitting idle.

**Why it's frozen:** Licensing and financial regulations. Too heavy for a side project.

**Potential future:** Concordium PayFi or stablecoins could sidestep traditional banking requirements. Or: rebuild as a local-first app using Boon, LocalSearch, and nostr/iroh for decentralized profile sync. No central server means no regulatory bottleneck.
