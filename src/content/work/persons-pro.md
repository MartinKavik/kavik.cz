Persons.pro is a platform experiment for connecting freelancers and open-source maintainers with sponsors and clients.
I am designing the product, prototyping user flows, and building the web experience so people can publish their work, get hired, or sell digital products without glue code.

The project is also a proving ground for Boon and MoonZoon, letting me validate the stack with real business logic and payments.
