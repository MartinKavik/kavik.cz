MoonZoon is a Rust fullstack framework that treats the frontend and backend as message-driven peers.
It focuses on WebAssembly-first delivery while still giving you a productive server side written in Rust.
I use it to prototype ideas quickly, wire hardware experiments, and build production-ready UIs that stay responsive under load.

Key ideas I keep iterating on:

- Ergonomic state management with messages instead of global stores
- Hot reloading while keeping application state intact
- A developer experience that feels closer to game engines than to traditional web stacks
