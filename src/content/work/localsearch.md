Fast searching and autocomplete without server round-trips.

**Performance**: indexes and searches 20,000 film titles in a few milliseconds.

I was hired to write this library to mitigate problems with slow or DDoSed backend servers — too many users hammering search queries.

Also integrated in the Persons.pro prototype for better UX, decentralization, and reduced backend costs.
