Full-text search library in Rust, developed for browser Wasm. For super fast searching and autocomplete.

Able to index and search through 20 000 film titles in a few milliseconds.

I was hired to write this library to mitigate problem with slow or DDOSed backend servers caused by too many users and search queries.

It's also integrated in Persons.pro prototype for better decentralization and saving costs for full-fledged backend servers.
