NovyWave aims to modernize the waveform viewer experience for FPGA and hardware debugging.
The project mixes a WebAssembly front-end with a Tauri desktop shell so large capture files stay fast while the UI remains portable.

I worked on the interaction model, accessibility of dense traces, and fast zooming/panning so engineers can stay in flow instead of waiting on redraws.
