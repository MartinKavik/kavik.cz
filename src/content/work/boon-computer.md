BoonComputer is a RISC processor designed for FPGA, written in Boon.

The goal is to prove that Boon can describe hardware as naturally as software. The same language that builds web apps can define CPU architecture, memory controllers, and I/O peripherals.

This project bridges the gap between high-level declarative programming and low-level hardware design.
