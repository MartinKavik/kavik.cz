In early 2021, I started writing a series of technical articles documenting the development of [MoonZoon](https://github.com/MoonZoon/MoonZoon) - a Rust fullstack framework where frontend and backend share one language, one type system, and work together from the start.

This post summarizes the key technical insights from those articles.

## The Problem: Web Development Complexity

Modern web development has become unnecessarily complex. New developers must learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Git, DNS, HTTP, REST, WebSockets, SQL, and authentication - a daunting prerequisite list. Then comes the decision fatigue: React vs. Vue, MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL, serverless vs. VPS.

The deeper problem? As I wrote in [Cure for Web Development](https://dev.to/martinkavik/cure-for-web-development-nnn):

> "It works, until you try to do the first major refactor - you'll feel like you are going through a minefield."

HTML and CSS, designed for simple web pages decades ago, cannot adequately serve modern applications.

## The Elm Architecture vs Components

One of the most popular articles in the series explored frontend architecture patterns. [MoonZoon Dev News 2](https://dev.to/martinkavik/moonzoon-dev-news-2-live-demo-zoon-examples-architectures-2oem) compared The Elm Architecture (TEA) with component-based approaches.

**TEA's strength** is that Model (the global state) provides "a single source of truth for all your data" - you can inspect the complete app state at any moment.

**TEA's weakness** is code fragmentation. Applications consist of "5 big isolated trees - Model, init, Msg, update and view" where modules spread across all of them. Inter-component communication becomes challenging: "you can't create custom subscriptions."

**Component-based approaches** attempt to solve this but introduce their own problems: excessive modularity, abstractions at incorrect levels, and heavy reliance on JavaScript compilation layers. Critically, "almost nobody really knows how to work with them effectively."

MoonZoon's Zoon took a hybrid approach using decorator-based blocks:

```rust
#[s_var]  // state variable
fn counter() -> SVar<i32> { 0 }

#[update]  // update handlers
fn increment() { counter().update(|c| c + 1); }

#[cache]  // computed/derived values
fn doubled() -> i32 { counter().inner() * 2 }

#[cmp]  // component rendering
fn root() -> Cmp {
    col![
        button![button::on_press(increment), "+"],
        text![counter()]
    ]
}
```

*Note: This was an early API design influenced by my work on [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed), a Rust frontend framework I maintained before MoonZoon. The current Zoon API evolved differently, with fewer macros and a builder-pattern approach.*

This naturally separates TEA's trees into standalone blocks while providing local component state through `cmp_var` - without polluting global state.

## Rust Hooks > React Hooks

The most popular article in the series, [MoonZoon Dev News 3](https://dev.to/martinkavik/moonzoon-dev-news-3-signals-react-like-hooks-optimizations-39lp), tackled a fundamental problem with React-style hooks.

React's hook system relies on call order to determine identity. The framework assigns unique IDs using a counter. Consider two render cycles where a conditional changes which hooks are called:

```
Render 1: mike() -> id=1, layla_rose() -> id=2
Render 2: mike() -> id=1, amber()      -> id=2  // wrong!
```

When conditional logic changes which functions execute, call IDs become unstable. State incorrectly associates with different components across renders. This is why React requires the "rules of hooks" - no hooks in conditionals.

**The Rust solution**: Rather than relying on indices alone, MoonZoon leveraged Rust's `#[track_caller]` attribute combined with `Location::caller()`. This identifies hook calls by their source code location:

```
Key = (call_index, file_location)
```

This approach proved more robust than React's index-based system, preventing data mismatches even with conditional rendering.

Eventually, MoonZoon moved beyond hooks entirely to a **signals-based reactive system**. Signals provide reactive data binding without requiring a Virtual DOM, eliminating the need for call counters, location tracking overhead, and rules-of-hooks compliance checks.

<Note>
This identity problem extends beyond hooks. List rendering in frameworks like React still requires explicit `key` props to track elements across renders - without them, reordering breaks and performance suffers. Elm and Seed had the same issue. MoonZoon's signal vectors (`MutableVec`) solved both problems by transmitting only differences at the data level, making keys unnecessary.
</Note>

The performance difference was dramatic. Using the [Dominator](https://github.com/Pauan/rust-dominator) library under the hood, Zoon could update thousands of rows basically immediately, while other Rust frameworks needed to re-render entire pages.

## Fullstack Architecture

The architecture looked like this:

### Three-Tier Structure

MoonZoon applications are organized into three crates:
- **Shared** - Serializable types for frontend-backend communication (using `serde_lite` to reduce Wasm file size)
- **Moon** (backend) - Actix-based server with virtual actors, inspired by Orleans, Phoenix, and Meteor
- **Zoon** (frontend) - Reactive UI with signals, drawing from elm-ui, Dominator, and Svelte

### Live-Reload via SSE

As detailed in [MoonZoon Dev News 1](https://dev.to/martinkavik/moonzoon-dev-news-1-cli-build-pipeline-live-reload-https-1ba6), the dev server uses Server-Sent Events (not WebSockets) for live-reload. The frontend receives two event types:
- **Reload Events** - Trigger page refresh after file changes
- **Backend Build ID Events** - Auto-reload when backend restarts

HTTPS runs during development to mirror production, with HTTP/2 eliminating SSE limitations.

### Warp to Actix Migration

[MoonZoon Dev News 4](https://dev.to/martinkavik/moonzoon-dev-news-4-actix-async-cli-error-handling-wasm-pack-installer-57cp) documented the migration from Warp to Actix. I wanted speed, async capabilities, and better Tokio integration. A key simplification: the `main` function became async, eliminating the need for separate `init` functions.

### Cleaner Error Handling

The mzoon CLI adopted a two-library approach:
- **anyhow** - Enables early returns via `?` without manual error mapping
- **fehler** - Eliminates verbose `Ok(())` wrapping through the `#[throws]` macro

### Virtual Actors for Sessions

[MoonZoon Dev News 5](https://dev.to/martinkavik/moonzoon-dev-news-5-chat-example-moonzoon-cloud-5de4) introduced virtual actors: "sessions are virtual actors managed by the Moon. Each SessionActor represents a live connection between the frontend (Zoon) and backend (Moon)." This enables broadcasting to all clients or targeting individual sessions via correlation IDs.

## Hard-Won Lessons

Building a fullstack Rust/WASM framework surfaced challenges that aren't obvious until you hit them.

### WASM File Size: Death by Dependencies

One of the most surprising findings was how dramatically dependencies affect WASM bundle size. Using a simple counter example:

| Configuration | Optimized | Brotli |
|:------------------------------|----------:|-------:|
| Base app | 33 KB | 14 KB |
| + `1.2.to_string()` | 52 KB | 21 KB |
| + `url` crate | 338 KB | 113 KB |
| + `url` + `regex` crates | 928 KB | 236 KB |

A single float formatting call adds ~19 KB. The `regex` crate alone adds ~590 KB due to Unicode tables. These numbers shaped MoonZoon's dependency choices:

- **serde_lite** instead of full serde
- **js_sys::RegExp** instead of the `regex` crate
- **web_sys::Url** instead of the `url` crate
- **ufmt** as an alternative to `std::fmt`

<Note>
These alternatives were hidden behind Cargo features, but they're no longer used. In practice, `serde` is everywhere - Rust's orphan rule (you can't implement foreign traits for foreign types) makes using alternatives nearly impossible when your dependencies expect serde. Similarly, `ufmt` wasn't a long-term solution because any regular float formatting in dependencies pulls in the standard formatting library anyway.
</Note>

The Cargo.toml optimization settings that worked best:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
opt-level = 3  # or 's' for size

[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]
wasm-opt = ['-O4']  # or '-Os' for size
```

<Note>
**The generics paradox**: Analysis with [Twiggy](https://github.com/nicholasjng/nicholasjng.github.io) showed that most code bloat from generics came from `futures-signals`. The intuitive fix - replacing generics with other constructs - made apps both slower AND bigger. Sometimes the compiler knows best.
</Note>

### Compression Pipeline Gotchas

MoonZoon's CLI generates both Gzip and Brotli variants of all assets. This uncovered several issues:

- **The async-compression bug** — The crate produced 9 KB output instead of the expected 16 KB. Fix: always call `.flush()` after `.write_all()`.
- **Browser quirks** — Firefox only supports Brotli over HTTPS, while Chrome accepts both on HTTP. Solution: serve both formats and select based on `Accept-Encoding`.
- **HTTP/2 necessity** — Browsers limit HTTP/1.x to 6 concurrent connections per domain. SSE holds a persistent connection, so you quickly run out. HTTP/2 multiplexes over a single connection — but browsers only support it over HTTPS. Result: HTTPS even in development.

### Build Tooling Challenges

The mzoon CLI faced several unexpected hurdles:

- **File watcher debouncing** — The `notify` crate (5.0.0-pre) lacked built-in debouncing. Custom implementation: abort-and-reset pattern where new file changes cancel pending rebuilds.
- **Directory traversal** — Rust lacks tail-call optimization, so recursive walking risks stack overflow. Solution: `futures::stream::unfold()` for iterative, non-blocking traversal.
- **Macro conflicts** — Combining `async-trait` with `fehler`'s `#[throws]` proved "deadly for the compiler." Fix: explicit `Result<()>` annotations.
- **wasm-pack auto-install** — The CLI auto-downloads wasm-pack from GitHub. Strict platform matching broke on Heroku. Fix: relaxed matching — any Linux can run the `musl` binary.

<Note>
Later, wasm-pack was replaced with standalone `wasm-bindgen-cli` for more flexibility - we didn't need wasm-pack features like generating npm packages.
</Note>

### SSE Reliability

Server-Sent Events for live-reload seemed simple but had edge cases:

- **10-second ping interval** to detect stale connections
- **Firefox permanently closes SSE** after backend restart - requiring the `ReconnectingEventSource` library for automatic reconnection
- **Certificate serial numbers** must be unique per generation, or Firefox throws `SEC_ERROR_REUSED_ISSUER_AND_SERIAL`

## From MoonZoon to Boon

![Boon logo](/images/boon_logo.png)

Many ideas from MoonZoon carried forward into [Boon](/#boon). The reactive signals architecture evolved into Boon's dataflow model. The frustration with HTML/CSS abstraction led to exploring new rendering approaches.

<Note>
In Boon, the WASM optimization battles move from app developers to platform maintainers. Dependency bloat becomes a runtime concern — users don't fight it, a small team solves it once.
</Note>

The core insight remained: web development is too complex because we're working at the wrong abstraction level. Both MoonZoon and Boon attempt to find that better abstraction — one that makes building web applications feel as natural as describing what you want to build.
